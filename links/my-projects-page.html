            <p>My first project I tackled was a simple Blackjack cardgame made with Java. It includes a GUI, elements of UI/UX design, and taught me a lot about how objects, classes and inheritance work. It's pretty bare bones as of now, as it was my first attempt at game design without a specific framwork, but I hope to improve upon the UI/UX in the near future.</p>

            <p>My second project was a calculator made with JavaScript. This one was more challenging for me, as learning about DOM maniuplation and event handling proved very tricky for some reason. I feel like JavaScript is difficult in general, and it was definitely outside of my comfort zone, but as in other areas in life, pushing myself out of my safe bubble proved better than I thought.</p>

            <p>Another one of my projects is the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. In my version, made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the user plays a game of RPS against the computer who randomly chooses an item from the list. If either one of the players reaches 5 round wins, then that person wins the game. I like this project a bit more, as it feels like a more fleshed out game than my other projects.</p>

            <p class = "last-paragraph ">These are only some of my beginner projects, but now that I have more resources available to me, I want to do a lot more, like database management projects, robotic projects, and more! So I hope you keep an eye on this website to see what I end up making!</p>
