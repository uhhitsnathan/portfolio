        <h3>Alright, now that we're in a better place, I can introduce myself better. <br> My name is Nathan, and I'm currently a student at College of the Canyons, a community college in my city, working towards getting my associates degree. I got into computer science pretty recently, as growing up I didn't have certain opporitunities to get into different hobbies. Nevertheless, even though my journey to become a SWE only recently started, my love for the subject keeps growing. It presents me with problems that challenge me, which are also rewarding to solve. There's just so much that can be made with code, like me building this website from scratch! There is also a software side to robotics, which just so happens to be one of my hobbies. Recently I got into coding with Arduino architecture and have made some pretty cool projects, so feel free to go check out my projects page and see what I've done. 
        <br> Thanks for your visit, and hope to see you again! </h3>
